Faster implementation (`~200x <#benchmark>`_) of the enhanced time-aware precision and recall (eTaPR) from  `Hwang et al <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477314.3507024>`_.
The original implementation is `saurf4ng/eTaPR <https://github.com/saurf4ng/eTaPR>`_ and this implementation is fully tested against it.

Motivation
----------

The motivation behind the `eTaPR <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477314.3507024>`_ is that it is enough for a detection method to partially detect an anomaly segment, as along as an human expert can find the anomaly around this prediction.
The following illustration (a recreation from the `paper <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477314.3507024>`_) highlights the four cases which are considered by eTaPR:

    :alt: Motivation behind eTaPR

1. A *successful* detection: A human expert can likely find the anomaly :math:`A_1` based on the prediction :math:`P_1`.
2. A *failed* detection: Only a small portion of the prediction :math:`P_2` overlaps with the anomaly :math:`A_2`.
3. A *failed* detection: Most of the prediction :math:`P_3` lies in the range of non-anomalous behavior (prediction starts too early). A human expert will likely regard the prediction :math:`P_3` as incorrect or a false alarm. The prediction :math:`P_3` is *too imprecise* and the anomaly :math:`A_3` is likely to be missed.
4. A *failed* prediction: The prediction :math:`P_4` mostly overlaps with the anomaly :math:`A_4`, but covers only a small portion of the actual anomaly segment. Thus, a human expert is likely to dismiss the prediction :math:`P_4` as incorrect because the full extend of the anomaly remains hidden. The prediction `P_4` contains *insufficient* information about the anomaly.

Note that for case 4, we could still mark the anomaly as detected, if there were more predictions which overlap with the anomaly :math:`A_4`.
Specifically, the handling of the cases 3 and 4 is what sets eTaPR apart from other scoring methods.

Getting Started
---------------

Install this package from PyPI using `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_ or `uv <https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>`_:

.. code::

    pip install faster-etapr

.. code::

    uv pip install faster-etapr

Now, you run your evaluation in python:

.. code::

    import faster_etapr
    faster_etapr.evaluate_from_ranges(
        y_hat=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        y=    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
        theta_p=0.5,
        theta_r=0.1,
    )
    {
        'eta/recall': 0.3875,
        'eta/recall_detection': 0.5,
        'eta/recall_portion': 0.275,
        'eta/detected_anomalies': 2.0,

        'eta/wrong_predictions': 2,
        'eta/missed_anomalies': 2,
        'eta/anomalies': 4,
        'eta/segments': 0.499999999999875,
        'point/recall': 0.45454545454541323,
        'point/precision': 0.5555555555554939,
        'point/f1': 0.49999999999945494,
        'point/TP': 5,

        'point/FN': 6,
        'point/anomalies': 4,
        'point/detected_anomalies': 3.0,
        'point/segments': 0.75,

        'point_adjust/f1': 0.7999999999995071
    }

We calculate three types of metrics:

- the `enhanced time-aware (eTa)
  <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477314.3507024>`_ metrics under
  ``eta/``
- the (traditional) point-wise metrics under ``point/``
- the `point-adjusted <https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03903>`_ metrics under
  ``point_adjust/``
